# Acknowledgement
I’m eternally grateful to Reem and our children, Finn and Simon. This book wouldn’t
exist without their love and support.
I greatly appreciate the help of AK Molteni, Gaylin Walli, Juan Torrez, Diana Lynch,
and my parents, Steve Cone and Kathie Lathan, who were sounding boards for the
website and book. Thanks to Josh Ellingson for creating the amazing, jaw-dropping
artwork on the cover. Last, but certainly not least, I’d like to thank you and everyone
else who has read and contributed to the Markdown Guide. You’ve not only made
this book possible, you’ve made it better!
