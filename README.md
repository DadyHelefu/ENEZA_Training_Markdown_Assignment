# Comrehensive Introduction of Markdown
I’m a technical writer, and I’ve used a lot of writing tools over the course of my
professional career. One of the most interesting tools I’ve encountered is a markup
language called Markdown.
My litmus test for a successful writing tool is whether using it can become second
nature. Does writing with it feel natural? Or do I feel like I’m constantly fighting
against it? I stop using tools that hinder me. Time is valuable, and I don’t have the
luxury of indulging things that squander that precious resource.
Markdown passes the test with flying colors. Writing using Markdown just feels
right. Since its introduction in 2004, millions of people have starting using it to
write everything from notes to documents. It’s one of the most successful markup
languages of all time.
Markdown has succeeded where other markup languages have failed because it
strikes the right balance between power and simplicity. It’s easy to learn and simple
to use. Its tremendous success means it’s ubiquitous enough to replace WYSIWYG
editors on websites like Reddit and GitHub. But Markdown is also powerful enough
to create documents, books, and technical documentation. Markdown is literally
everywhere.
I’ve been using Markdown for years now and I recommend it to everyone I know.
There are lots of reasons why you should learn to write using Markdown, but one of
the best reasons is that it’s better than the alternatives. Learning Markdown means
you can stop using all the subpar writing tools you’ve tolerated for years. It can also
further your career. Believe it or not, knowing how to write using Markdown is a
requirement for many jobs.
That brings us to this book. I couldn’t find a comprehensive Markdown reference
guide, so I decided to create one.
The Markdown Guide has humble beginnings. It started as a single webpage in 2017.
After receiving positive feedback from friends and coworkers, I decided to expand
the site. To my astonishment, the Markdown Guide was receiving hundreds of unique
Introduction ii
visitors a day by early 2018. At that point, it occurred to me that people might also
appreciate the Markdown Guide in book format.
I hope you enjoy reading this book as much as I’ve.
